### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work at GitHub as a Senior Solutions Engineer. I look after our clients in the APAC West Region focusing on Northern India and South-East Asia. 

Before I started working in Sales I used to work as a Software Engineer in Australia. I have worked with DevOps, Banking and Finance, eLearning companies developing using TypeScript, Javascript, .Net, JAVA and Ruby Scripts. A developer at heart, I made the move into Sales to help other engineers reach reach their potential through amazing developer experience and tools that help them stay in the flow. 

Talk to me about how GitHub Copilot, GitHub Source Code Management and Advanced Security can help you and your organization improve your DevSecOps lifecycle, implement a shift-left approach and, improve your metrics such as MTTR, error rates and code quality.
